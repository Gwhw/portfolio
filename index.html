      <h1>Oliver Salameh</h1>
      <p>
        I am a rather simple man who enjoys coding websites and doing other tech
        related stuff. My hobbies are playing video games, screwing with
        computers, and touching grass.

            <h4>Shadow's Games</h4>

              I made this website just so that I can play games in school. Works
              pretty well and is very low maintenance.

              This website was made to describe me, my interests, and my
              projects. I plan to use it in my adult life as a resume.

          <h4>Where I'm From</h4>
          <p>
            I am from the beautiful country of Lebanon. The mountains, snow, and
            culture never cease to amaze people! Right now, I live in crappy America. It sucks.

            As I said in before, I am from Lebanon, and with that comes Lebanese food. I enjoy moghli, zaatar sandwiches, labne, and many other dishes. I also like some American meals.
